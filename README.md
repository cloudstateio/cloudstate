**Cloudstate is no longer actively developed**

Cloudstate was an open source protocol and reference implementation exploring ideas for _stateful serverless_, and was originally developed by [Lightbend].

The project is no longer active, since 2021. An open source alternative is [Eigr].

A continuation of the ideas can be found in Lightbend's platform-as-a-service [Akka Serverless].
