= Cloudstate
:page-type: simple

Cloudstate paves the way for Serverless 2.0. It consists of two things:

* A standards effort—defining a specification, protocol between the user functions and the backend, and a TCK.
* A reference implementation—implementing the backend and a set of client API libraries in different languages.

Lightbend sponsors an open source version of Cloudstate and offers a pay-for-use hosted version. View the Cloudstate documentation:
