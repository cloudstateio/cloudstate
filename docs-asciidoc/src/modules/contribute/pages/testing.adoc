=== Compliance Testing

The https://github.com/cloudstateio/cloudstate/blob/master/tck/src/it/resources/application.conf[TCK] makes it possible to verify that combinations of backends and frontends behave as expected. In order to make a frontend eligible for testing in the TCK a sample application, implementing a simple https://github.com/cloudstateio/cloudstate/tree/master/samples/js-shopping-cart[Shopping Cart] (here showcased with the Node.js frontend) is required.

In order to make sure that each individual component performs its duties, and when combined has the expected outcome, the following categories need to be considered.

=== Verification of backend functionality

Answers the question: How do we know that a given backend performs the duties expected of it when paired with a frontend and a user function written for that given backend?

Solution:

Devise a TestKit using one of the frontend implementations which will:

  * Use a preselected frontend implementation
  * Define a set of user functions
  * Make calls to those user functions
  * Verify the results of those interactions with expected outcomes
  * Mandate a /live and /ready endpoint for all backend implementations

Implementation details:

  * Create an Akka-based frontend implementation
      - Gives us a Java and a Scala viable frontend implementation
  * Define invalid user functions for different reasons to verify behavior caused by user error
  * Define a canonical correctly-behaving user function which exercises the different combinations of interactions expected
  * Define a set of tests which simulates different types of networking / lag issues
  * Use the generated client library to call the user function

=== Verification of frontend functionality

Answers the question: How do we know that a given frontend performs the duties expected of it when paired with a backend and a user function written for that given frontend?

Solution:

  * Use the existing backend implementation
  * Define a canonical set of permutations of gRPC service descriptors
  * Require each frontend implementation to implement the user functions based on the canonical set of permutations of gRPC service descriptors
  * Use generated clients from the canonical set of gRPC service descriptors to call the frontend implementation
  * Verify that the end results are as expected

Implementation details:

=== Managing external dependencies

Answers the question: How do we know which the external dependencies are, and if they are configured properly, and that they are available to perform the duties assigned to them?

Solution:

  * Require that backend implementations are ready when their /ready endpoint says so.
  * Require that frontend implementations are ready when their ready() gRPC endpoint says so.

Implementation details:

  * Will vary on a per-backend and per-frontend basis
  * Verify using CI

=== End-to-end testing

Answers the question: How do we know that a given backend, frontend, and user function, we get the expected results when we call the user function?

Solution:

  * Permute backend + frontend combinations + frontend user functions for verification
  * Verify that calling the verification services' gRPC contract gives the expected outcomeâ€”thereby validating that end-to-end communcation works.
  * Simulate container failures at specific (or even stochastic) points to ensure that operation of the combination is within spec.

Implementation details:

  * None for now

=== User function testing

Answers the question: How does the user test their user functions?

Solution:

  * Implement a TestKit as a part of each frontend user function API
  * Document how to add such tests, optionally generate a test harness which can be plugged into the builds for that platform.

Implementation details:

  * Will depend on each frontend implementation
  * API should be idiomatic for each specific platform
