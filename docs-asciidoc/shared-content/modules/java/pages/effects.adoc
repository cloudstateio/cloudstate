This page documents how to use Cloudstate CRDT effects and forwarding in Java. For high level information on what Cloudstate effects and forwarding is, please read the general @ref[Forwarding and effects](../../features/effects.md) documentation first.

## Looking up service call references

To forward a command or emit an effect, a reference to the service call that will be invoked needs to be looked up. This can be done using the @javadoc[ServiceCallFactory](io.cloudstate.javasupport.ServiceCallFactory) interface, which is accessible on any context object via the @javadoc[`serviceCallFactory()`](io.cloudstate.javasupport.Context#serviceCallFactory--) method.

For example, if a user function serves two entity types, a shopping cart, and a CRDT that tracks which items are currently in hot demand, it might want to invoke the `ItemAddedToCart` command on `example.shoppingcart.HotItems` as a side effect of the `AddItem` shopping cart command. This reference can be looked up like so:

@@snip [ShoppingCartEntity.java](/docs/src/test/java/docs/user/effects/ShoppingCartEntity.java) { #lookup }

This could be looked up in the constructor of the entity, for later use, so it doesn't have to be looked up each time it's needed.

## Forwarding command

The `CommandContext` for each entity type implements `ClientActionContext` to allow forwarding a command by invoking @javadoc[`ClientActionContext.forward()`](io.cloudstate.javasupport.ClientActionContext#forward-io.cloudstate.javasupport.ServiceCall-). For example, if the item being processed in the `addItem` command is a "hot" item, we can make the `HotItems` entity aware of that item by forwarding a command:

@@snip [ShoppingCartEntity.java](/docs/src/test/java/docs/user/effects/ShoppingCartEntity.java) { #forward }

## Emitting an effect

The `CommandContext` for each entity type implements `EffectContext` to allow emitting an effect by invoking @javadoc[`EffectContext.effect()`](io.cloudstate.javasupport.EffectContext#effect-io.cloudstate.javasupport.ServiceCall-boolean-). For example, upon successful completion of the `addItem` command by `ShoppingCartEntity`, if we also want to emit an effect on the `HotItems` entity, we would invoke the effectful service call as:

@@snip [ShoppingCartEntity.java](/docs/src/test/java/docs/user/effects/ShoppingCartEntity.java) { #effect }

Please note that, contrary to command forwarding, the result of the effect is ignored by the current command `addItem`. More details in the common section @ref[Forwarding and effects](../../features/effects.md#forwarding-and-effects)
