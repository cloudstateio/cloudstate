# Deployment spec for a journal. A journal is a logical abstraction over a database
# deployment, and captures how to deploy and connect to that database. Multiple
# EventSourcedFunction's would use a single journal.
apiVersion: cloudstate.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventSourcedJournal
metadata:
  name: cassandra
spec:

  # The type of Journal - valid values would come from an enum of supported databases.
  # Currently, Cassandra is the only supported database.
  type: Cassandra

  # The deployment type, ie, how this Journal is deployed. Valid values would depend on
  # the Journal type, but all types would support "Unmanaged", which indicates that the
  # operator doesn't manage/deploy the database itself, ie, the user has to deploy
  # the database themselves. For Cassandra, future supported values might include
  # "GoogleCloudMarketplace", which would deploy Cassandra using Google's Application
  # CRD, or "InstaclustrOperator", which would deploy Cassandra using Instaclustr's
  # Cassandra operator.
  deployment: Unmanaged

  # Type and deployment specific configuration for the journal.
  config:

    # The name of the unmanaged Cassandra service to connect to.
