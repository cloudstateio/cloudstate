/**
 * Marks a method as a snapshot handler.
 *
 * <p>If, when recovering an entity, that entity has a snapshot, the snapshot will be passed to a
 * corresponding snapshot handler method whose argument matches its type. The entity must set its
 * current state to that snapshot.
 *
 * <p>An entity may declare more than one snapshot handler if it wants different handling for
 * different types.
 *
 * <p>The snapshot handler method may additionally accept a {@link SnapshotBehaviorContext}
 * parameter, allowing it to access context for the snapshot, and potentially change behavior based
 * on the state from the snapshot, if required.
