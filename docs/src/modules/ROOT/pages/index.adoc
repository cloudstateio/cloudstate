Cloudstate offers a serverless platform for general-purpose application development with _stateful_ services, fast data/streaming, and the power of reactive technologies. With Cloudstate you can build cloud native applications for the Kubernetes ecosystem with true elastic scalability, high resilience, and global deployment.

The Serverless movement today often focuses on automating the underlying infrastructure. However, there are equally complicated requirements at the application layer. The move toward fast data, streaming, and event-driven stateful architectures creates new challenges for operating systems in production.

Stateless functions are a great tool that already have their place in the cloud computing toolkit. However, for Serverless to reach the grand vision of a Serverless world of modern data-centric real-time applications, we must address the hardest problem in distributed systems: managing state—your data.

The https://cloudstate.io[Cloudstate] project takes on this challenge and paves the way for Serverless 2.0. It consists of two things:

. **A standards effort** — defining a specification, a protocol between the user functions and the backend, and a Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).
. **A reference implementation** — implementing the backend and a set of client API libraries in different languages.

Cloudstate's reference implementation leverages https://cloud.google.com/knative/[Knative], https://grpc.io/[gRPC], https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/index-cluster.html[Akka Cluster], and https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] running on https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]. This combination results in applications that not only scale efficiently, but  manage distributed state reliably at scale while maintaining a global or a local level of data consistency, opening up for a whole range of new addressable use-cases.

Join us in making this vision a reality!

== How to get started

This documentation contains information for developers who want to use Cloudstate to create and deploy stateful services; for administrators who want to configure Kubernetes clusters to run Cloudstate, either for development or in production; and for those who would like to contribute to the Cloudstate open source project. The following table suggests reading paths for these roles for typical use cases.
